          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>The grammar of any language is a core. It is important to know the basic rules.
          I am going to expand this part with each update.
          There are few things that I would like to share with you about Russian language.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1. In Russian we don't have any articles. It is obvious from a content what you mean.</li>
            
            <li>2. The verb to be (быть) is not very important. Usually we don't use it in the Present tense.</br>
            I am Antony. - Я Энтони.</br>
            It is my car. - Это моя машина.</br>
            Today is a nice day. - Сегодня хороший день.</br></li>
            
            <li>3. There three genders in Russian: masculine, feminine, neuter.</li>
            
            <li>4. You must agree words in gender, numbers and cases in Russian. You do it changing the endings of words.</li>
            
            <li>5. There are conjugation of the verbs.</li>
            
            <li>6. There are cases. Probably it is the most difficult part in grammar.</li>

            <li>7. The main purpose of any language learning is an art (or science) of the creation the sentences. In Russian 
              you can put the words (pronouns, nouns, adjectives and verbs) in various positions. Of course there are many rules
              how to do it.
